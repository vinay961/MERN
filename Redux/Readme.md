## Redux
It is a JS library for predictable and maintainable global state management.
It store the data at one central place, from where we can access them no matter from which component.
It make the code cleaner, redable and maintainable.

### Main building block of redux are
1. combineReducer() -> It combine multiple reducer function into a single reducer function.
2. createStore() -> This function create the redux store, which holds the state of our app.
3. applyMiddleware() -> Used to add middleware to our redux store.
4. bindActionCreator() -> It binds action creators directly to dispatch, so you can call them easily.
5. compose() -> Used to combine multiple functions from right to left.
